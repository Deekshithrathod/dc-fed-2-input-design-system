## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TSqutYM4c5WtluM7QzGp) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- [x] **User story:** I can see error state
- [ ] **User story:** I can choose to disable input
- [x] **User story:** I can choose to have helper text
- [ ] **User story:** I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- [x] **User story:** I can have different input sizes
- [x] **User story:** I can have different colors
- [x] **User story:** I can choose to have input take the width of the parent
- [x] **User story:** I can have multiline input like a `textarea`
- [x] **User story:** When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- [x] **User story:** I can still access all input attributes
- [ ] **User story (optional):** Show input in a similar way like the design or use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Otherwise, showing the input in multiple states is enough
